This project aimed to enhance my abilities in Streamlit development. I also refreshed my knowledge of data manipulation in Python during the process. It proved to be a valuable project for testing both analytical and programming skills.

# Project Overview

The main objective was to create a interative opensource dashboard.


I like to structure it as below -
